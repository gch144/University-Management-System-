# University-Management-System-in-C++


This project allows for university administration to manage and keep track of a database of multiple universities and their departments with students and teachers. Each student is assigned a unique ID depending on the number of students ever employed by that university. Similarly, teachers are defined with unique ID as well. This 
allows for removal, addition of universities and departments with students and teachers. The format of the “constructors” allows for mass creation/deletion of student and teacher records. This also allows us to keep track of the departments each of the teachers and students they work/study in. in student we can provide each students
full name with grades and date of birth and in teacher we can provide each teacher name with specialization. Each department is linked to only one specific university
